product_hmw: How might we enable real estate owners to indicate interest in selling property without actively listing their property?
product_narrative: |
  With the increase in competition for real estate investment and development opportunities in urban cores, real estate developers/acquirers are searching for any edge that they can find when competing for properties and development sites. 
  By building our project, we enable the owners to indicate their interest in selling properties and facilitate the real estate development cycle for developers.
